Terminal Minesweeper

Here are going to be the notes trying to outline the things I need to code or figure out, before I build towards a functional Minesweeper game.

-Create a grid, possibly a grid with numbers by letters axes (for the sake keeping it simple, no modifying options yet, as far as size or the amount of mines go)
-Create a random mine generator for the grid
-Create a number generator that will create the numbers for the surrounding mines
-Create a corresponding covered grid, that will "open" the grid fields
-Create a function that will uncover or flag a selected field:
  1) Have it take only legit coordinates
  2) Add the ability to Uncover or flag
  3) You can make 1 mistake (2 and you're out)
  4) Perhaps add a logic that if all numbers are uncovered, you win and don't have to flag the last mine(s)

-SPICY: Create a logic that when opening an empty grid field it would open all the empty fields and stop at the number.
