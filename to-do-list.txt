Terminal Minesweeper

Here are going to be the notes trying to outline the things I need to code or figure out, before I build towards a functional Minesweeper game.

1) Create a grid, possibly a grid with numbers by letters axes (for the sake keeping it simple, no modifying options yet, as far as 
size or the amount of mines go)
2) Create a random mine generator for the grid
3) Create a number generator that will create the numbers for the surrounding mines
4) Create a corresponding covered grid, that will "open" the grid fields
5) Create a function that will uncover or flag a selected field:
  a) Have it take only legit coordinates
  b) Add the ability to Uncover or flag
  c) You can make 1 mistake (2 and you're out)
  d) Perhaps add a logic that if all numbers are uncovered, you win and don't have to flag the last mine(s)
  e) Add a flag counter

6) SPICY: Create a logic that when opening an empty grid field it would open all the empty fields and stop at the number.
  a) essentially if you hit "0", you should check all fields around you and look for other "0", whilst uncovering all the number fields
  b) would be smart (perhaps) IF the logic could remember which tiles were checked (or at least the "0" ones), so it does not loop 
  through already uncovered fields OR not get stuck going back and forth between the "0" tiles
  c) Probably have to create a list of uncovered tiles, so as to not loop through them again, could be included with the point 5d
